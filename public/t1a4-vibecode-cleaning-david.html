you need to put the cleaned code here. No CSS, no confusing divs and paragraphs. Just as simple as possible webpage html. <br><br>

if doing javascript script are the variables sensibly named using camelcase "myVar" etc don't use promises (.then) instead use async/await, no addEventListeners unless necessary, get chatgpt to make the changes. More changes... Only simple Javascript nothing fancy.

Here is the original vibecode<br>
